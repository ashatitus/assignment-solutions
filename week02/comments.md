## General comments:

1. Nice work in general
2. when loading a file, some students used absolute path to students' own computers or they used file.choose() in R. This means people who share the repository with them are not able to access them. 
3. not all questions were answered. Many students did not answer Q1 and Q2
4. separating your codes into different chunks in ipynb to enhance readability is preferred
